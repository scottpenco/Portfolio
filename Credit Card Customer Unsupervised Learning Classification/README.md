## Project Overview

AllLife Bank wants to focus on its credit card customer base in the next financial year. They have been advised by their marketing research team, that the penetration in the market can be improved. Based on this input, the Marketing team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers. Another insight from the market research was that the customers perceive the support services of the back poorly. Based on this, the Operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model, to ensure that customers queries are resolved faster.

## Impact 
In this project we are aiming to identify groups of credit card customers. This was completed using unsupervised learning classification. After exploritory data analysis was performed, models were creadted using K-Means and GMM to complete the task. These classifcation models were compared and reflect that 3 groups of customer types exist. Types of customers should be contacted using preffered methods based on the groups, these actionable insights can help improve business performance.

## Project Overview

This project aims to reduce the number of features by using PCA and tSNE. Reducing and clustering the car engines, revealed three groups.

| Variable Name | Description                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| mpg           | Miles per gallon                                |
| cyl           | Number of cylinders                             |
| disp          | Engine displacement (cu. inches) or engine size |
| hp            | Horsepower                                      |
| wt            | Vehicle weight (lbs.)                           |
| acc           | Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (sec.) |
| yr            | Model year                                      |
| car name      | Car model name                                  |

## Impact 
Analyzing the dataset reveals insights into many business decisions:
Predictive models could be built on these groups to determine the fuel efficency of engine attributes. 
Understanding what engine attributes have the most weight could also promote designing of fuel-efficent models. 
Grouping these engine classes allows for market segmentation and for manufactors to target the appropriate customers.

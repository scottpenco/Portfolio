Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasites. According to the World Health Organization in 2020, half the worldâ€™s population is at risk for malaria. Due to the prevalence and severity of the disease, malaria surveillance is important in disease control. The ability to detect the virus among populations helps world organizations understand the impact the disease can have on patterns and most affected populations.
Infected red blood cells from malaria are characterized as losing the disc-liked shaped of regular red blood cells. This morphological trait is diagnostically significant in determining if someone has contracted the disease. Typically this is done by the human-eye. However this project aims to create an artificial intelligence model, through CNNs, that can predict the status of a patients red blood cells. This automated system can provide easier earlier detection and classification of infected individuals, and alleviate any burden from human error or labour associated with human detection.
Given the morphological differences in red blood cells for non-infected and parasitized individuals, this provides us with a few concepts that must be explored before a design solution can be determined. Given the proposed solution is machine learning model, we must first understand how the observable difference between cells can be quantized. This can be achieved using image processing through libraries such as OpenCV. It is also important to understand what tool is the best when image processing, and creating our neural network so that our model can characterize precisely and optimally.
The problem itself from a data science perspective is one of image recognition. After choosing the correct image processing techniques, we can quantize our data by converting the images into arrays of integers. These integers can train our model on pre-determined red blood cells. This classification model will be a potential solution to quicker and earlier diagnoses in malaria patients.


## Data Exploration
The data obtained is an image set of 27,558 coloured pictures from microscopes. These coloured pictures are correctly identified as being parasitized or uninfected. From this data set train and test sets have been sub categorized for our machine learning.
From the image data set, we can see the morphological difference between uninfected and parasitized cells. This visual difference in the typical spherical shape of red blood cells is critical for our machine model to determine the categorization of our test sets. Determining the most efficient classifier for this parameter will be critical to our solution. From the data, it seems some images have noise and are low resolution. This may impact the accuracy of our model as these factors can contribute to our model failing proper categorization. Some cleaning up and image processing before training our data could improve the functioning.

## Proposed Approach
As discussed the primary approaches to creating the model proposed will be Image cleaning, and designing a neural network. These are broad contexts however and the following will provide a more detailed explanation of the approach:
Preprocessing images using OpenCV to reduce noise and processing the images to be more accessible for our machine model to characterize. From the data it seems that changing the colour profile will help distinguish the cell shape; this can be done after cleaning up our data. Using convoluted neural network, we can train and test the data. After our initial test, our model can be improved on using different hyper parameters and adjusting layers of our characterization layers.
Precision will be our best predictor of our models success, as this will be our best predictor of repeated results. The F1 score will also be recorded and noted, this will also give us a numerical value. These measures of success will be used to compare our first model to our successive and tuned models. This will allow us to choose the most precise and accurate model that will be predictive in determining the infected status of red blood cells. The proposed model will be compared with the VGG16 Model to show the effectiveness of having a specified model.

Hi, I'm Scott Pencoüëã

About Me:

Highly curious and motivated about the field of Data Science, machine learning and AI. History of building and using data science tools, statistical modelling and data analysis in Python. Foundations in statistics and data analysis to help with analytical skills and model optimization. Interested in problem solving and expanding domain knowledge by turning raw information into actionable insights. Continually seeking learning opportunities from various certifications and projects in AI and Machine Learning. Open to collaborating with others and learning from professionals.

My Journey
- üéì Baccalaurate Double Major Degree in STEM field: Biology/Bioinformatics.
- üìö Completed Higher Education in Bioinformatics and Data Science
- üå± Constantly learning and improving my skills with certifications and Projects.


Projects in my Portfolio:

Python üêç
-  [Amazon Product Recommendation](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Amazon%20Product%20Recommendation)
    - Amazon uses different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users.
    - Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.
    - In this case study, we built recommendation systems based on: Rank-based using averages, User-user-similarity based collaborative filtering, item-item similarity based collaborative filtering, Matrix factorization collaborative filtering
- [Boston House Price Prediction Linear Regression](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Boston%20House%20Price%20Prediction%20Linear%20Regression%20Scott%20Penco)
    - Housing Price can vary depending on a number of features. A model was built to predict the housing price of Boston Housing.
    - Model highlighted important features when determining the house price. 
- [Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20Street%20View%20Housing%20Number%20Digit%20Recognition)
    - A CNN was created to determine the digits of housing numbers taken from street view. This model has potential to help the accuracy of map data, such as google maps to provide accurate addresses.
    - 2 CNN models were created, with the second showing improvements in validation accuracy due to drop-out-layers. 
- [Credit Card Customer Classification](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Customer%20Unsupervised%20Learning%20Classification)
    - Analysis on credit card customers was performed to improve campaigns for specific types of customers.
    - Using unsupervised learning 3 groups of customers were identified using K-Means and Gaussian Mixed Models. These groups can be used to target specific types of customers. 
- [Predicting Potential Customers](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20-%20Predicting%20Potential%20Customers)
    - Analysis was performed on customer data of Online Education service to determine what customers are good leads, and what factors lead to these conversions.
    - A model was built using Decision Trees and Random Forest to determine which customers are likely to convert to paid customers.
    - Marketing insights were extrapolated from the resulting trees, suggesting that marketing can target these profiles of customers to improve recruitment rates.
- [Auto MPG Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Dimensionality%20Reduction)
    - Dimensionality Reduction was performed on the Auto MPG data set to determine similarities and insights in the data.
    - PCA and tSNE were used, the results showed evidence for 3 groups of engines.
- [Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Hotel%20Booking%20Cancellation%20Prediction%20Classification%20-%20%20Scott%20Penco)
    - Many hotel bookings are cancelled or no-shows. A model was built to predict which customer's rooms are likely to be cancelled. This can be used to help hotels anticipate which rooms will be cancelled and act accordingly to improve profits.
    - The model was built using Logistic Regression, and hyper-parameters were tuned with GridSearchCV.
- [Malaria Cell Classification ü¶ü](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/66e71b5df2eb315186c728684edeee256ef63c5a/Malaria)
    - Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasites. Infected red blood cells from malaria are characterized with a morphological difference between healthy cells. 
    - A dataset of ~27,000 images with infected and un infected cells was used to train CNN models to classify cells as infected or not. 
    - This project includes presentation slides.
- [Movie Reccomendation](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Movie%20Reccomendation)
    - Netflix houses many movie, and user data. This can be used to build a recommendation system to recommend users to relevant movies.
    - 3 recommendation systems were built: Knowledge/Rank Based Recommendation, Similarity-Based Collaborative Filtering, and Matrix Factorized Based Collaborative Filtering.
- [Forecasting Stock Prices with Time Series](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Forecasting%20Stock%20Prices%20with%20Time%20Series)
    - A time-series model was built to determine the projection of stock prices.
    - The data was analyzed, and made stationary before computing different models: AR model and ARIMA.
    - ARIMA model performed the most accurate for forecasting the stock data.

SQL üóÑÔ∏è
-  [Golden Age of Video Games](https://github.com/scottpenco/Portfolio/tree/main/Golden%20Age%20of%20Video%20Games)
    - Used SQL to analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. Found the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best.

## Project Overview:
Objective:
The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in extracting relevant information from biotech conference documents versus a custom fine-tuned model trained on specialized prompts for the same domain. This involves assessing the quality, relevance, and contextual accuracy of information retrieved by each approach.

This project is still in progress, with ongoing evaluation and adjustments to the model and RAG integration. Early results are being analyzed to refine both the prompt design and document retrieval relevance in RAG.
